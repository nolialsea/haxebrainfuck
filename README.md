# haxebrainfuck
Brainfuck interpreter with extended types in haxe

Don't mind the CPU thing, i intended to run multiple "threads" on the same memory alternatively, but it was for another project. 
Just consider it's a single core and it will be fine. 
I will rewrite this part, if i feel i need to, maybe, one day. Maybe never.
